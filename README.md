# Invoicer

**Invoicer** creates invoices based on LateX templates from CSV worklogs.

## TL;DR

```shell
invoicer -r Recipient.toml -w worklog.csv -o output_folder
```

Using [jobber](https://github.com/fightling/jobber):

```shell
jobber --export | invoicer --stdin
```

## Usage

Invoicer needs at least one *recipient* and one or several *worklogs* as input.
Worklogs are merged and then assigned to each recipient based on the contained tags.
An invoice is created for each recipient.

The application can be configured by editing the default config `invoicer.toml` or by providing a custom config as TOML file.

### Recipient

The recipient information can be retrieved from a TOML file, which looks like this:

```toml
companyname = "Example Client"
locale = "de"

[contact]
fullname = "Jane Doe"
street = "123 Fake St."
email = "jane.doe@exampleclient.com"
zipcode = 1234
city = "Berlin"
country = "Germany"
phone = "+49123456789"
```

The name of the TOML file is the recipients name (`ExampleRecipient.toml` will be `ExampleRecipient`). 

### Worklog without tags

Worklogs in CSV format can be used as source to generate invoice positions.
Worklogs CSVs can be generated with [jobber](https://github.com/fightling/jobber):

```shell
jobber --export 2.10...31.10. --tags SomeTag --csv "Start,Hours,Rate,Message"
```

An example for worklog may look like this:

```csv
"Start","Hours","Rate","Message"
"10/04/2023 14:00",3,100,"Source Code Review"
"10/05/2023 14:00",2,100,"Source Code Review"
"10/05/2023 16:00",1,100,"Account Setup"
"10/16/2023 09:00",0.5,100,"Source Code Review"
"10/16/2023 09:30",1.5,100,"Discussion"
```

You can also add severals worklogs at once:

```shell
invoicer -r Recipient.toml -w worklog_october.csv -w worklog_december.csv -o output.tex
```

The output is a tex file `output.tex`, which can compiled to PDF with MikTeX or TexLive.
The `-o` argument is optional, the output name can be generated via the format string given in the `invoicer.toml`.

### Worklog with tags

An example for worklog with tags may look like this:

```csv
"Tags","Start","Hours","Message"
"CustomerB,donuts","10/04/2023 14:00",3,"Yummy"
"ExampleRecipient,dev","10/05/2023 14:00",2,"Source Code Review"
"CustomerB,beer","10/05/2023 16:00",1,"Getting drunk"
"ExampleRecipient,dev","10/16/2023 09:00",0.5,"Source Code Review"
"ExampleRecipient,dev","10/16/2023 09:30",1.5,"Discussion"
```

*CustomerB" and "ExampleRecipient" have tags defined in TOML files.
The recipient information will be stored in the folder `tags`.
Based on the example CSV above, to create two invoiced from the CSV, we need to TOML files called `CustomerB.toml` and `ExampleRecipient.toml` in `tags`.

Each TOML file contains the recipients' address and a list of tags, e.g. the file `ExampleRecipient.toml`:

```toml
[contact]
companyname = "Eine kleine Firma"
fullname = "Max Mustermann"
street = "Musterstra√üe 12"
email = "m@firma.com"
zipcode = 1234
city = "Berlin"
country = "Germany"

[tags]
dev = "Software Development"
```

The following command will eventually produce two invoices with timesheets:

```shell
invoicer -w worklog.csv
```

You can also use `jobber` to pipe its export output into `invoicer`:

```shell
jobber --export | invoicer --stdin
```

### Windows

```powershell
pdflatex.exe .\output.tex
```

### Linux

```shell
pdflatex output.tex
```

## Locales

An invoice can have different *locales* (aka language), which are stored in the `locales` folder as TOML files.
Currently, only `de` (German) and `en` (English within EU) are supported.

## Default template

The default LaTex template is located in `templates/invoice.tex`.
You can either edit this template or copy it and enter the new template filename in `invoicer.toml`.

## TODO

Some features are currently missing:

* Installing invoicer
* Define a custom folder for tag TOML files
* Automatic invoice counting based on hashes
* Directly generating PDFs using [tectonic](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic)
* Generating invoices using [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)
* ...

## Known issues

On Windows, when exporting CSVs from jobber, there are encoding issues with non-ASCII characters.
